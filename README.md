# Let's talk about workers :)

## Running the project

To run this project, you must have three opened terminals in order to start the `/react`, `/api` and `/worker` servers. In development mode, you shoud run the following commands:

```sh
# To install all dependencies, just run this command on project's root.
yarn

# For each folder (/react, /api and /worker), run:
yarn dev
```

## /har folder

The `/har` folder was meant to run analysis on network requests (exported on Chrome). It was crucial to make my undergraduate thesis and you can read it in portuguese [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/135eR09Zz-p9mTJHRHPqIfZWN3GV2bXXS/view).
